#This code simulate markov switching on a state space S, using initial distribution mu, sojourn parameters lam, and jump matrix Q.

#It can simulate a Stochastic Differnetial Equcations with markov switchingï¼Œ more details in https://github.com/QiaoJianYe.

#Change the jump matrix Q and state space S to generate different kinds of data
